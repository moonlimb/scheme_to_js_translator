What is a compiler? (from wiki)

A computer program that transforms source code written in a programming language (source langauge) into a computer language (the target language, often having a binary form known as object code). Often to create an 'executable program'

Compiler: high-level programming language to a lower level language
		ex. low-level include assembly langauge or machine code

Decompiler: low-level languag to a high-level one

Language translator/source to source translator/ langauge converter:
	a program that translates b/w high-level langauges

Compiler
- lexical analysis
- preprocessing
- parsing
- semantic analysis (syntax-directed transltion)
- code generation
- code optimization

the first compiler was written by Grace Hopper
- build a compiler in C

compiler construction and compiler optimization
compilers enable the development of machine-independent pograms:w
